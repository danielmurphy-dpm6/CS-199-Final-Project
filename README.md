# CS-199-Final-Project

## Group Name:
Client-Server Multi-terminal chat

## Group Members:
Daniel Murphy(dpm6)

## Project Introduction:
We intend to implement a asynchronous chat-server and client in Rust using the Tokio runtime package. The goal of our project is to host a server which will connect multiple clients on different machines, allowing them to chat with one another. We chose to create a client-server project because we thought that using Rust's multithreading system would make this idea particularly interesting to implement compared to other languages.

## Technical Overview:
### Milestone 1 10/30/23:
Abstractifying a message. Abstractifying a user, potentially giving them an internal / external ID which allows users to sign in on their own and other terminals respectively.
### Milestone 2 11/15/23:
Set up interface for a single user.
### Milestone 3 12/1/23:
User-user communication.  
### Potential Extensions:
Add image and MP3 capability.

## Possible Challenges
Operating in the terminal will not be common for most users. Working with UI in Rust.
